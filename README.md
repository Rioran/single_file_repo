# Welcome to the README file!

This whole projects purpose is to be cloned into your codespaces. You'll need a terminal command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rioran/single_file_repo.git
```

It must be invoked from your users directory. And even better - from you own folder inside it since your codespaces user is "ubuntu".

Check the assignment details to learn what to do next.
